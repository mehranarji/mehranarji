### Hi there 👋
Here are some of my career projects alongside some fun projects that I'm participating in.

For the start, you can check out the [Chat client](https://mehranarji.github.io/react-chat-client/) that I've made. it's still in progress but you can already have some fun with it.

Since I'm a big fan of computer games (especially Minecraft ⛏️) there are some games that I made for browsers, you can also take a look at them.
